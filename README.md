# Exploration and Visualization of USAPL Powerlifting Data

### Executive Summary
This Shiny app will analyze the most updated USAPL Powerlifting database. This database is the webscraped result of meets in the United States from the USAPL website. With powerlifting as a hobby, it was an interest of mine to understand the competition and to hopefully make it easier for other competitors and the general public to understand meet results. Analysis of the data will include comparisons of competitors and data visualization in graphs and maps. 

## Data Question
What types of competitions are available in each state? How has powerlifting changed in each state? Did it grow or is it lacking numbers? What were the statistics from each meet? How can I make the data more viewer-friendly and allow more comparison interaction with the user?

### Data Sources
